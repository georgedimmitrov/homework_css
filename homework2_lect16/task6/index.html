				<h1>CONTENT: notes on this 3col Fixed assignment</h1>
	
				<p>As in the 2column exercise, thecolor change is detectible where the div meets the .jpg background. I used the same hexideimal number in the PS doc as was used in the HTML?</p>
				
				<p>This exercise uses a main wrapper background image as one fixed strip. I get serious Float Drop when I resize (reduce) the browser window. I think that is what "display: inline; /*stops IE doubling margin on float" is for, but would like further explanation to understand this comment.</p>
				
				<p>Is keeping the #wrapper div necessary in a stylesheet if there is also going to be seperate version wrappers as we have here to contain the different background images? Or perhaps this is an example of an inner div as the book suggests? I am still confused on that detail.</p>

				<p>Even though I have auto margin sets on the wrapper div, the page still huggs the left side? I've tried it in all of them, but it won't budge?</p>

				<p>Obviously, this footer has a mind of it's own.. it's in the wrapper but the "clear" seems to be allowing it outside. However, when I remove the clear, it hugs the bottom of the header?</p>
